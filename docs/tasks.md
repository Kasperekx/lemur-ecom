# Awwwards-Style Navbar Enhancement Tasks

**Timestamp**: 2024-12-19_16-45

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Hooks

- [x] Create custom hook `useCursorPosition` for tracking cursor globally
- [x] Create custom hook `useMagneticEffect` for magnetic hover animations
- [x] Create utility functions for distance calculations and easing
- [x] Create custom hook `useReducedMotion` for accessibility
- [ ] Set up CSS custom properties for dynamic color variables

## Phase 2: Magnetic Navigation Effects

- [x] Implement magnetic hover effect for desktop navigation links
- [x] Add cursor-following spotlight/glow effect behind navigation items
- [x] Create smooth scale and rotation animations on hover
- [x] Add magnetic effect to logo with custom transform origin
- [x] Implement elastic bounce-back animations when cursor leaves

## Phase 3: Advanced Background Animations

- [ ] Create animated gradient mesh background component
- [ ] Implement floating geometric shapes with physics-based movement
- [ ] Add cursor-reactive particle system
- [ ] Create subtle noise texture overlay for depth
- [ ] Implement smooth color transitions based on page context

## Phase 4: Typography & Text Animations

- [ ] Split logo text into individual characters for animation
- [ ] Implement staggered character reveal on page load
- [ ] Add text morphing/glitch effects on navigation hover
- [ ] Create smooth text scaling with optical size adjustments
- [ ] Add text shadow and glow effects that follow cursor

## Phase 5: Enhanced Micro-Interactions

- [ ] Redesign search button with morphing states
- [ ] Implement liquid button morphing for contact CTA
- [ ] Add progressive hover states with multiple animation layers
- [ ] Create floating action button with physics simulation
- [ ] Add subtle haptic feedback simulation for touch devices

## Phase 6: Advanced Mobile Menu

- [ ] Redesign mobile menu with full-screen immersive overlay
- [ ] Implement curved path animations for menu items
- [ ] Add staggered reveal animations with custom bezier easing
- [ ] Create interactive background elements (floating shapes)
- [ ] Add gesture-based interactions (swipe, pull-to-refresh feel)

## Phase 7: Performance & Polish

- [ ] Optimize animations for 60fps performance
- [ ] Implement RAF-based scroll listeners
- [ ] Add smooth scroll momentum for mobile
- [ ] Create preloader animation for navbar elements
- [ ] Add debug mode for animation performance monitoring

## Phase 8: Accessibility & Responsiveness

- [ ] Ensure all animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation with new animations
- [ ] Optimize touch interactions for mobile devices
- [ ] Add focus indicators that work with magnetic effects
- [ ] Test screen reader compatibility

## Phase 9: Final Touches

- [ ] Add sound effects for interactions (optional)
- [ ] Create Easter eggs (Konami code, hidden animations)
- [ ] Implement theme switching with smooth transitions
- [ ] Add loading states for all interactive elements
- [ ] Final performance audit and optimization

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Test on various screen sizes and orientations
- [ ] Test with reduced motion preferences enabled
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation throughout
- [ ] Test touch interactions on mobile devices
- [ ] Performance testing with DevTools
- [ ] Accessibility audit with screen readers
